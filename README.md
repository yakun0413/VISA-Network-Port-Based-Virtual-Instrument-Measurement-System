Bachelor thesis named “VISA Network Port Based Virtual Instrument Measurement System”
The technical innovations brought by Virtual Instrument in the field of automated
test, make the development of instrument software occupying an increasingly
important position. Therefore, it is a great significance that using VISA interface
connects different functions of the test equipment together for collaborative
management and software control.
The main research topic is as an example to controlling optical pectrum analyzer
by computer, to achieve Spectrometer parameter setting, data access and automated
measurement by VISA interface based on MATLAB software platform.
The successful operation of the system proves the feasibility and effectiveness of
the VISA interface based virtual instrument measurement system. It also proves that
the application of VISA network port by virtual instrument technology has wide
application prospects and promotional value.
